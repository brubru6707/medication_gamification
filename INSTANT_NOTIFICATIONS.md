## 📱 What You'll See

### 50% Milestone Notification

When you log a dose that brings the child to 50% progress:

```
📅 Medication Milestone Reached!

[Child Name] is 50% through their [Medication Name] 
treatment! Consider scheduling a follow-up 
appointment with the doctor.
```

**Example:**
- Child has 20 total doses (10 days × 2 times/day)
- You've logged 9 doses (45%)
- Click "Log dose" → Now at 10 doses (50%)
- **💥 Notification appears immediately!**

### Overdose Warning Notification

When you log a dose that exceeds 100% progress:

```
⚠️ OVERDOSE WARNING - Exceeded Treatment Duration!

[Child Name] has taken more [Medication Name] doses 
than prescribed (105%)! STOP taking this medication 
and contact your doctor immediately.
```

**Example:**
- Child has 20 total doses prescribed
- You've logged 20 doses (100%)
- Click "Log dose" → Now at 21 doses (105%)
- **🚨 WARNING notification appears immediately!**

## 🧪 Test It Right Now

### Test 50% Milestone

1. Go to **Your Children** page
2. Find a child with medication at 45-49% progress
3. Click **"Log dose"**
4. **Instant notification** when it crosses 50%!

### Create a Test Case

If you don't have a medication near 50%:

1. Add a new medication for your child:
   - Times: 2 (AM/PM)
   - Duration: 10 days
   - Total doses: 20
2. Click "Log dose" **9 times** (brings to 45%)
3. Click "Log dose" **1 more time**
4. **🔔 50% notification appears!**

### Test Overdose Warning

1. Add a medication with **2 total doses**:
   - Times: 1 per day
   - Duration: 2 days
   - Total: 2 doses
2. Click "Log dose" **2 times** (100%)
3. Click "Log dose" **1 more time** (150%)
4. **🚨 Overdose warning appears!**

## 💡 Key Features

✅ **Instant** - Notifications appear the moment you click "Log dose"  
✅ **Local** - No server required, works offline  
✅ **Smart** - Only notifies when crossing thresholds (not every dose)  
✅ **Context-aware** - Shows child's name in notification  
✅ **Visual** - Notifications stay visible until dismissed (50%) or require interaction (overdose)  

## 🔍 How Progress Calculation Works

```javascript
Total Doses = Times per day × Duration (days)

Example:
- Times: ["08:00", "20:00"]  // 2 times per day
- Duration: 10 days
- Total: 2 × 10 = 20 doses

Progress %:
- Taken 9 of 20 = 45%
- Taken 10 of 20 = 50% ← Milestone!
- Taken 20 of 20 = 100%
- Taken 21 of 20 = 105% ← Overdose!
```

## 🆚 Difference from Firebase Cloud Functions

### Browser Notifications (What You Just Got)
- ✅ **Instant** when clicking "Log dose"
- ✅ **No deployment** needed
- ✅ **Works offline**
- ❌ Only works when app is open
- ❌ Only works when you manually log dose

### Firebase Cloud Functions (Requires Deployment)
- ⏰ Scheduled time-based reminders
- 📊 Monitors Firestore for any change (not just manual logging)
- 🔔 Works even when app is closed
- 🌐 Works from any device
- ❌ Requires `firebase deploy --only functions`

## 🎯 Best of Both Worlds

**Use Browser Notifications for:**
- Immediate feedback when logging doses
- Quick milestone celebrations
- Safety alerts (overdose warnings)

**Use Firebase Cloud Functions for:**
- Automated time-based reminders
- Notifications when app is closed
- Server-side monitoring

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No notification appears"

**Check 1: Browser Permission**
- You must have granted notification permission
- Check NotificationBanner at top of page

**Check 2: Threshold Crossing**
- Notification only appears when crossing 50% or 100%
- Not on every dose!

**Check 3: Console Logs**
Open DevTools (F12) and check console for errors

### "Notification appears but no sound"

Overdose warnings have `silent: false` but 50% milestones are silent by default. This is intentional.

### "Notification doesn't show child name"

Make sure the child has a `displayName` in their profile. The code will use "Your child" as fallback.

## ✨ What's Next

Now that you have instant notifications working:

1. **Test it** - Log some doses and see the notifications
2. **Deploy Firebase Functions** - Get time-based reminders too
3. **Share feedback** - Let me know if notifications are helpful!

**Enjoy your instant medication milestone notifications! 🎉**
