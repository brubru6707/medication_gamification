# ✅ Parent Medications - Log Dose & Notifications Added!

## 🎯 What Changed

The **+ Add Meds** page (parent's own medications) now has:

1. ✅ **"Log dose" button** on each saved medication
2. ✅ **Doctor checkup notifications** when progress > 50%
3. ✅ **Overdose warnings** when progress > 100%

**Same functionality as Your Children page!**

## 📱 How It Works Now

### Before (No Logging)
```
+ Add Meds page showed medications with "hideLog"
→ No way to mark doses taken
→ No notifications
```

### After (Full Functionality)
```
+ Add Meds page shows medications with "Log dose" button
→ Click to mark dose taken
→ Instant notifications at >50% and >100%
```

## 🔔 Notifications You'll Get

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Checkup (>50% Progress)

When you log a dose that brings your progress above 50%:

```
👨‍⚕️ Time for a Doctor Checkup!

Your [Medication] progress is at 65%. Consider 
scheduling a follow-up appointment with the 
doctor to review the treatment.
```

**Triggers:** Every dose logged when progress is **> 50% and ≤ 100%**

### ⚠️ Overdose Warning (>100% Progress)

When you log a dose that exceeds the prescribed duration:

```
⚠️ OVERDOSE WARNING - Exceeded Treatment Duration!

You have taken more [Medication] doses than 
prescribed (105%)! STOP taking this medication 
and contact your doctor immediately.
```

**Triggers:** Every dose logged when progress **> 100%**

## 🔍 Code Changes Summary

### Added to `add-med/page.tsx`:

1. **Import pushEvent:**
   ```typescript
   import { loadMeds, saveMeds, pushEvent } from "@/lib/storage";
   ```

2. **logDose function:**
   ```typescript
   const logDose = async (medId: string) => {
     // Updates progress
     // Saves to localStorage
     // Logs event
     // Shows notifications at >50% and >100%
   }
   ```

3. **Updated MedicationCard:**
   ```typescript
   <MedicationCard 
     med={med} 
     onLog={() => logDose(med.id)}  // Was: hideLog
   />
   ```

---

## 🎯 Notification Logic

```javascript
Progress calculation:
- Total doses = times.length × duration
- Progress % = (taken / total) × 100

Notification triggers:
- 51%, 60%, 75%, 90% → 👨‍⚕️ Doctor checkup
- 100% → 👨‍⚕️ Doctor checkup (last reminder)
- 101%, 105%, 110% → ⚠️ Overdose warning

No notification:
- 0-50% progress
```
