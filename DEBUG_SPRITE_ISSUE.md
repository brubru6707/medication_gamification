# 🔍 DEBUG: Why Am I Seeing Fireball Placeholder?

## ✅ CHECKLIST (Do these in order):

### 1. Is the Sprite Generation Server Running?

**Open a NEW PowerShell window and run:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\brubr\Documents\FUQ_WINDOWS\bat_cave\medication_gamification_2\public\medication_gamification"
node sprite-generation-server.js
```

**You should see:**
```
🚀 Sprite Generation Server running on http://localhost:3002
```

**Keep this window OPEN!** Don't close it while using the game.

---

### 2. Test if Server is Running

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3002
```

You should see a message like "Sprite Generation Server is running!"

If you see an error or nothing loads, the server isn't running.

---

### 3. Check Browser Console for Errors

1. **Login as a CHILD account**
2. **Go to Meds page** (`/meds`)
3. **Open Developer Tools** (Press F12)
4. **Go to Console tab**
5. **Click the purple "Battle" button** on a medication

**Look for these logs:**

✅ **SUCCESS (Server is working):**
```
⚔️  BATTLE BUTTON CLICKED!
📦 Medication data being sent:
   - Account ID: [your user id]
   - Med ID: [medication id]
   - Med Name: [medication name]
🔗 Navigating to: /game?medData=...

🎮 GAME PAGE - MEDICATION DATA CHECK
✅ Successfully decoded medication data:
   - Account ID: ...
   - Med ID: ...
   - Med Name: ...

🔍 Loading medication data...
📊 Using medication from URL: [your medication]
🎨 Requesting AI sprite generation from backend...
✅ Monster and sprite created successfully!
```

❌ **ERROR (Server not running):**
```
POST http://localhost:3002/generate-sprite 404 (Not Found)
❌ Error calling sprite generation backend
⚠️  Make sure the backend server is running
```

---

### 4. Check if You're Logged in as CHILD

The Battle button **only appears for CHILD accounts**.

**To verify:**
1. Open Developer Console (F12)
2. Type: `localStorage.getItem('medminder_user')`
3. Look for `"role":"child"` in the output

If you see `"role":"parent"`, you need to:
1. Logout
2. Login with a CHILD account
3. Go to `/meds` page

---

### 5. Check if Medication Data is Being Passed

After clicking Battle, check console for:

```
📦 Medication data being sent:
   - Account ID: [should NOT be 'unknown']
   - Med ID: [should NOT be empty]
   - Med Name: [should be your medication name]
```

If Account ID is `'unknown'`, you're not logged in properly.

---

## 🚀 QUICK FIX STEPS:

### Step 1: Start the Server
Double-click: `start-sprite-server.bat` in your project root folder

OR run manually:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\brubr\Documents\FUQ_WINDOWS\bat_cave\medication_gamification_2\public\medication_gamification"
node sprite-generation-server.js
```

### Step 2: Verify Server is Running
Go to: http://localhost:3002 in your browser

### Step 3: Test the Battle Button
1. Login as CHILD
2. Go to `/meds`
3. Click purple "⚔️ Battle" button
4. Check console for success messages

## 🎯 WHY YOU SEE FIREBALL PLACEHOLDER:

The game shows a fireball when:

1. ❌ **Server not running** → Can't generate sprite
2. ❌ **No medication data** → Using default placeholder
3. ❌ **Sprite URL is empty** → Monster exists but sprite failed
4. ❌ **Wrong account type** → Not logged in as child

---

## 📊 Expected Data Flow:

```
Child clicks Battle
    ↓
Medication data encoded in URL
    ↓
Game page receives data
    ↓
firebase-browser.js reads URL
    ↓
Checks Firebase for monster
    ↓
If not found → Calls sprite server
    ↓
Gemini AI generates sprite
    ↓
Saves to Firebase
    ↓
Monster appears in game!
```

---

## 🔧 Still Not Working?

**Share these console logs:**
1. Everything after clicking Battle button
2. Full error messages (red text)
3. The output from the sprite server window

**Check these files have your changes:**
- `components/MedicationCard.tsx` → Should have `handleBattle` function
- `app/(protected)/game/page.tsx` → Should read `medData` parameter
- `public/medication_gamification/firebase-browser.js` → Should have `getMedicationData()` function
